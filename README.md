## 🌐 What is ZK-SETU?

ZK-SETU is a **concept prototype** that demonstrates how a user can complete KYC **without sharing any document**, by generating and sending **mathematical proofs instead of personal data**.

A user imports Aadhaar offline XML → the app extracts only a **secure hash** → later, when a bank asks for a proof (like age > 18), the app responds with a **Zero-Knowledge style proof** (mocked) rather than a document.

This simulates future-ready “privacy-preserving KYC”.

## 🧩 Components in This Repository
1. **androidapp/**  
   Mobile ZK-KYC wallet (Jetpack Compose). Contains screens, activities, UI components.
2. **issuer-server/**  
   Prototype issuer backend. Issues credentials after validating Aadhaar hash.
3. **verifier-server/**  
   Prototype verifier backend. Sends proof requests & verifies incoming ZK proofs.

## 📱 Mobile App Architecture (Android)

### User Flow

1. Launch → Set / Enter PIN  
2. Import Aadhaar (XML/ZIP)  
   - Only SHA-256 hash is computed  
   - No document is uploaded  
   - No PII stored  
3. Wallet stores a **credential** generated by the issuer  
4. Verifier (bank) sends a proof request  
5. User sees:  
   - Verifier name  
   - Purpose  
   - Nonce  
6. User taps **Allow**  
7. App returns a **mock Zero-Knowledge Proof**  
8. “Proof Verified” page with animation

### Security Notes
- Only hashes are stored  
- All processing on-device  
- ZK proofs are **mocked** (prototype only)

## 🔐 Zero-Knowledge KYC Logic (Simplified)

### Credential (Prototype)
```json
{
  "credentialId": "cred-001",
  "attributesHash": "SHA256(AadhaarData)",
  "version": 1
}
```

---

## 🔍 Example Proof Request (from Verifier)

```json
{
  "verifier": "State Bank of India",
  "purpose": "age_over_18",
  "nonce": "XJ3921AB"
}
```

---

## 🧪 App-Generated ZK Proof (Prototype)

```json
{
  "credentialId": "cred-001",
  "proofType": "age_over_18",
  "nonce": "XJ3921AB",
  "zkProofBlob": "ABCD1234FAKEPROOF"
}
```

## 🏦 Issuer Server (Prototype Overview)

**Role**  
Issues digital credentials after validating Aadhaar hash.

**Flow**
- App sends SHA-256 hash  
- Issuer returns a credential object  
- No personal identity data is transmitted

---

## 🏢 Verifier Server (Prototype Overview)

**Role**  
Acts like a bank requesting and verifying proofs.

**Flow**
- `/request-proof` → sends proof request  
- `/verify-proof` → checks:  
  - Nonce match  
  - Credential ID match  
  - Mock proof blob validity

---

## 🎨 UI Notes
- Light-theme only  
- Gradient “ZK SETU” branding  
- Simple onboarding with 5-step privacy explanation  
- All screens animated with subtle fade/slide transitions

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **prototype** demonstrating flows and UX.  
Not production-ready.  
ZK proofs are mocked.  
No real Aadhaar processing, no real identity, no backend trust validation.
